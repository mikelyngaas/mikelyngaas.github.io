# Questions to Revisit

## Git & GitHub

1. **Merge options on GitHub PRs**: There were three options when merging a PR (Merge commit, Squash and merge, Rebase and merge). What does each one do, and when should I use which?

2. **Architecture diagram**: Build a high-level diagram showing how these pieces connect: the files on my computer (local repo), GitHub (remote repo), the live website (GitHub Pages), and any other key components. How do changes flow between them?

3. **Learn to manually open a PR on GitHub**: Walk through the full workflow hands-on -- creating a branch, making copy edits, opening a PR in the GitHub UI, reviewing the diff, and merging. Goal: be able to do this independently going forward.
